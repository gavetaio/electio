# Electoral Tools — @gavetaio

The purpose of this repository is to share all parallel code strategies produced while crafting the word sets of the <a href="https://gaveta.io/eleicoes"><b>Election Drawer</b></a> from the <a href="https://gaveta.io"><b>@gavetaio/liber</b></a> artistic-scientific project; allowing for anyone to question and properly attempt to falsify its conclusions.

## Falseability — To coders

Way too many words were crafted into this project, but, on its pluriversal sum, it all converges to one singularity: `the quantitative electoral integrity natural language interpretation breakdown through algorithmic code`. The main goal of this coding exercise is to question how easily we, humans, have been playing loose with natural language interpretation.

The Brazilian `Superior Electoral Court`’s understanding of its own `Electoral Code` is so problematic that it opens an opportunity for this algorithmic analysis since it can be easily expressed, compared, and tested, in the face of its clear conflicts with cemented international principles and human rights guarantees.

## Falseability — To non-coders and fact-checking organizations

Given the fact that we, as sentient human beings, seem unable to grasp a multidisciplinary abstraction without fancifully imagining the existence of a multitude of infinite solutions, we have deliberately pushed the falsifiable paths to be done through international comparison; but, you can still abstractly argue about them, which will also be formally reviewed.

## Brazilian DRE black-box — Refactored prototype

The DRE prototype was crafted as a personal challenge to understand if it would be possible to properly close the user experience on the same grounds as the current legacy UI; but, instead of ignoring, following every electoral norm from the Brazilian Electoral Code that acts in the protection of its voter intent.

- For accessing the DRE emulator/prototype, run the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/"><b>ElectronJS</b></a> app and access the `Simulador` tabs.

## Brazilian Electoral Database — ElectronJS application

The official **Brazilian Electoral Database** available at <a href="https://dadosabertos.tse.jus.br/"><b>dadosabertos.tse.jus.br</b></a> lacks completeness and a unified structure. For properly interrogating its contents, it was initially developed as a cmd-line <a href="https://nodejs.org/"><b>NodeJS</b></a> tool, but ended up evolving into a full <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/"><b>ElectronJS</b></a> application due to the increased complexity of its investigations. The app isn't intended for non-coding users though; as it was built with a focus on being a flexible research tool.

- For installing it, just run `yarn install && yarn post && yarn start`.
- All the app's text is in its original **Portuguese** natural language.
